# Aquaculture Dataset Cleaning

This repository contains an R script developed to clean and process historical environmental and biometric data from EPPO, the Pilot Fish Farming Station operated by IPMA in Olh√£o. 
The objective is to structure this data to identify growth patterns and support the development of a predictive fish growth model tailored to the S2AQUAcolab production systems.
